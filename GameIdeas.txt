Game Ideas

Top Down Scrolling Shooter -
-Shots mutate and breed
-The player is the fitness function, they determine what shot types survive and which die
	-the function that can be mutated is called every tick to move the shots
		-basic functionality has one movement function
	-shot variables ( speed, quanity, size, direction, pulsating size )
	class gun {
		direction[] // array of directions
		quanity 	// number of shots fired
		period		// if quanity > 1 period determines the delay between the shots
	}
	class shot {
		travelSpeed
		travelFunction // Don't know how I could mutate travelFunctions
		sizeMin
		sizeMax
		sizePeriod		// The pulsation between Min and Max
		
		//energy cost to fire is based on all of these
	}
	-breeding is done by averaging variables
	-mutation is done by randomizing one of travelSpeed/Func sizeMin/Max/Period
	
Player has a second gun that is controlled by the mouse that is used to pickup control powerups.  Mutate/destroy/keep

At the end of a level the player can breed the shots they collected and kept.

Enemies could also have geneticaly created behaviors.  Their fitness function would be how long they survive for and the "Boss" then breeds the most successful ones.

Storyline - 

You are inside an infected organism.  They the infection is trying to mutate you into a larger object so that you kill the organism from within.

Goal - to evolve into something tiny enough to destroy the infection from the source.
