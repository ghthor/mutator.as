Goals - Live as long as possible
No Win Condition Yet

Mechanics -
Everytime you score a kill the spawn time is slightly lowered
Everytime the enemy hits you your ship size is increased
Everytime you hit an enemy the chance of them spawning with weapons is higher
This all eventually snowballs into an unwinable situation

To compile the .fla you need my wcl.as source library in the .fla's sourcepath

If you clone them side by side the wcl.as and mutator.as it will work magically, since the fla is setup for that right now

git clone http://github.com/ghthor/mutator.as.git
git clone http://github.com/ghthor/wcl.as.git

And your good to go reading and hacking if you so desire
